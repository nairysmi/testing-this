My universal remote is complete. 


The only possible thing to add would be more cool capabilities.Further improvements are a matter of choice and preference. 

One idea was a timer to turn the appliance off at a certain time of the day based on real time.
Another idea was to store appliance states even when the appliance terminal is closed.
The last idea was to actually hook a device up to the computer instead of using terminal windows as virtual devices.
